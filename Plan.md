Here are things we need to Improve or Change.

Our Goal is that When I selected n number of macthes any player from two of them. When i click on any player of particular match A Modal Pops up @modal.html and a Button "Add to Bet Slip" WHen I click that button my bet added to BetSlip Then There is a Bet Slip Contaciner whose dom strcutrie is at @bet_slip_dom.html. I goto That container Inside MultiBet Section leave single and ALternte Combination Bet Section Focus on MultiBet and there is a Input Field For Entering stake amount, Lets say I entered 0.10 usd and Then There is button"Place Bets". I click This Button and Bet is Placed. Now I want that Bot should capture what Matches I have selected and It have to reselect those matches with Differnt player as currently we are selecting players and Displaying but we have to Reselec the place the bets automatically.

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Automated Opposite Player Selection
**PROS:**
- Simple and straightforward implementation
- Directly selects the opposite player (if player A was selected, it selects player B)
- Fully automated process with minimal user intervention
- Already implemented in the current codebase

**CONS:**
- Less flexible - always chooses the opposite player
- Could be predictable in betting patterns over time
- May not work well if there are more than two selection options per match

### Approach 2: Random Player Selection with Favorites/Underdogs Ratio (ACTIVE)
**PROS:**
- More sophisticated betting strategy
- Maintains a balance of favorites (60%) and underdogs (40%)
- Less predictable betting patterns
- Can be optimized based on historical performance
- Currently implemented and active

**CONS:**
- More complex implementation
- Requires tracking player odds to determine favorites
- May need additional data processing to maintain the ratio
- Requires more computation to generate appropriate combinations

### Approach 3: Machine Learning-Based Player Selection
**PROS:**
- Most advanced and potentially profitable approach
- Can learn from historical betting results
- Adapts to changing odds and player performance
- Can identify patterns that humans might miss

**CONS:**
- Significant development effort required
- Needs substantial historical data to train effectively
- More resource-intensive on client's browser
- More complex to maintain and update
- May require server-side components for model training

## Current Implementation

The bot currently implements Approach 2, using a sophisticated strategy that maintains a 60% favorites / 40% underdogs ratio when selecting players. This provides a more balanced betting pattern while introducing randomness in the selections to avoid predictability.

Please Provide 3 ways to do that and tsate PROS ans CONS of each
